1. As a control program, operating system schedules and manages the allocation of all resources in the computer system --> **False**
2. An OS is a software that provides a working environment for the applications of users --> **True**
3. From the system's viewpoint, the operating system acts as an easy interface between the user and computer system      --> **False** 
4. From the user’s viewpoint, the operating system acts as a resource manager, control program, and virtual machine manager. --> **False**
5. Tập hợp các lệnh cần thiết để khởi động, nghĩa là để tải hệ điều hành vào trong RAM được gọi là bộ khởi tạo (initialier).  --> **False**
6. Shell is the part wherein only essential modules of the operating system are placed --> **False**
7. Multi-tasking systems place more than one job/program/task in the main memory of the system. The jobs are scheduled by time-sharing technique. --> **True**
8.  Monolithic systems were not suitable for multi-programming/multi-tasking environments due to the unprotected behaviour of the system. --> **True**
9.  As a virtual machine manager, operating system provides a layer on the actual hardware on which it performs the tasks of the user. And to the user, it seems that all the work done is by the hardware. --> **True**
10. Kernel is the part wherein only essential modules of the operating system are placed. --> **True**

12. Second chance is also a page replacement algorithm -- > **True**
13. The set of instructions needed for booting, that is, to load the OS in RAM is known as initialier. --> **False**
14. Layered architecture provides the modularity where in there is a defined layer for each group of functionality --> **True**
15. Multi-user systems place more than one job/program/task in the main memory of the main computer system. The jobs are of different users who are connected through terminals to the main computer. The jobs are scheduled by time-sharing technique. --> **True**
16. As a resource manager, operating system controls the user activities, 1/0 access, and all other activities performed by the system. --> **False**
17. Memory allocation is generally performed through two methods: static and dynamic allocation. --> **True**
18. The primary goals of operating system are convenience of the user and best utilization of the hardware. --> **True**
19. The instructions, which are not directly executed by the user but need to be passed to the OS, are known as privileged instructions. --> **True**
